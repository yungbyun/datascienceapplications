# Mission
* We do shopping on-line, for example, at Amazon.com, coupang.com, and etc. 
* After some clickings of items, we finally add an item to a cart to purchase. 
* You can see an example of data below.

* Step1: Data Analysis showing some graphes (anything would be ok including basic statistics)
* Step2: Recommendation using existing machine learning algorithms (You can use prediction or classification)
